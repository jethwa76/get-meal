# Toggle Bar Improvements Implementation Steps

## Navigation Toggle Improvements
- [ ] Add smoother animations with spring-like transitions to hamburger icon
- [ ] Include visual feedback with subtle glow effects on hover
- [ ] Add micro-interactions on hover/press (scale, color change)
- [ ] Improve the hamburger icon design (thicker lines, better spacing)

## Form Toggle Improvements
- [ ] Modernize the design with rounded corners and better shadows
- [ ] Add smooth sliding animation for the toggle knob using spring transition
- [ ] Include icons (bell for notifications) for better UX
- [ ] Add hover and focus states with color transitions

## Testing & Verification
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes (responsive design)
- [ ] Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Ensure performance impact is minimal (check animation performance)
